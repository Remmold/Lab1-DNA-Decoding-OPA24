# ðŸ”¬ Sequence Extractor & Analyzer  

**This project was developed as part of a school assignment** to practice working with file handling, data processing, and visualization in Python. The goal was to extract sequences from a text file, process the data, and generate a graphical representation using Matplotlib.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- **Extracts sequences** from text files using `">"` as a delimiter.  
- **Cleans and processes** sequences while removing unwanted characters.  
- **Counts occurrences** and stores results in a **list of dictionaries**.  
- **Generates visualizations** using Matplotlib.  

## ðŸš€ How It Works  
1. Reads the file and **splits sequences** using the `">"` sign.  
2. Strips whitespace and removes invalid characters.  
3. Counts occurrences of relevant characters.  
4. Outputs a **list of dictionaries** containing the processed data.  
5. (Optional) **Visualizes** the results with Matplotlib.  

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Remmold/Lab1-DNA-Decoding-OPA24.git
   cd Lab1-DNA-Decoding-OPA24
